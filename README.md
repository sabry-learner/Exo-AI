# ExoAI — Automated Exoplanet Classification System

## Overview
**ExoAI** is an AI-powered platform developed for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge** to automate the classification of exoplanet candidates using open-source data from **Kepler**, **K2**, and **TESS** missions.  
The system integrates **machine learning**, a **.NET 9 backend**, and a **Flutter-based interface** to deliver accurate, real-time predictions and improve the efficiency of exoplanet discovery.

## What We Built
### Machine Learning Engine (Python)
Developed an ML model trained on NASA’s Kepler, K2, and TESS datasets using **XGBoost** and **Logistic Regression**.  
The model classifies signals as confirmed planets, candidates, or false positives with an accuracy exceeding **95%**.

### Backend API (.NET 9)
Built a secure and scalable REST API for predictions, data management, and model retraining.  
Implemented with **Entity Framework Core**, **JWT authentication**, and **Docker** for deployment.

### User Interface (Flutter)
Created a responsive web dashboard that enables users to upload datasets, visualize predictions, view confidence scores, and retrain the model interactively.

## Impact
ExoAI automates exoplanet identification, reducing manual analysis time by **approximately 80%**.  
It provides researchers and students with direct access to NASA’s datasets through an accessible, user-friendly interface, accelerating the pace of exoplanet discovery and promoting open scientific collaboration.
